npx create-react app folderName
npx vs npm = npx executes not only installs and will always get the newest edition of the template.

most companys create a components folder in src, for structur of the directory.

filenames for classes(js) should start with upperacse

"import { Component } from 'react';" is not enought, in the local scope when using JSX you need to include React : "import React, { Component } from 'react';"

Props, JSON object that contains keys and values, what you pass as parameters to make dynamic content in React

inside React render method, don't put semicolons

super() refers to the class above, this refers to the class itself.

Why use arrow functions = In regular functions, "this" is not bound to where it is called (very unpredictable),
In arrow functions they are bound to the function

Async functions in javascrip:
  if we have line 1 which takes 10 secens and a line 2 that is independent from line 1 and maybe you need to specify
  that you want to wait for line 2 before starting line 1
  a callback is a function that you send as a parameter and is called back at a later point.
  a call center --> different ways to call in and get help. most cases: you call in, are on holdand have to wait
  until it is your turn until the call center is ready to help (you have access to the resource)
  --> instead you can call the call center, they get your number and then call you back when they are ready to call you back
  same with a function --> when it is ready to be called it will be.
